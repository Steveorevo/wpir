Control infrared devices using WordPress and LIRC on RaspberryPi. First, you should configure your RaspberryPi with PHP7 and SQLite. You can get started at http://steveorevo.com/raspberry-pi3-and-php-7/. More information about setting up RaspberryPi with LIRC can be found at http://alexba.in/blog/2013/06/08/open-source-universal-remote-parts-and-pictures/


## Roadmap
* Invoke LIRC asynchronously from WordPress with security (ajax with nonce) [DONE]
* Learn and store new remotes as a Custom Post Type [TODO]
* Arrange macro sequences as a Custom Post Type [TODO]
